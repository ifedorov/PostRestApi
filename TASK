Object of this task is to create a simple REST API based social network in Django, and
create a bot which will demonstrate functionalities of the system according to defined rules.
Social Network
Basic models:
● User
● Post (always made by a user)
Basic features:
● user signup
● user login
● post creation
● post like
● post unlike
For User and Post objects, candidate is free to define attributes as they see fit.
Requirements:
● Token authentication (JWT is prefered)
● use Django with any other Django batteries, databases etc.
Optional (will be a plus)​:
● use clearbit.com/enrichment for getting additional data for the user on signup
● use emailhunter.co for verifying email existence on signup
Automated bot
This bot should read rules from a config file (in any format chosen by the candidate), but
should have following fields (all integers, candidate can rename as they see fit):
● number_of_users
● max_posts_per_user
● max_likes_per_user
Bot should read the configuration and create this activity:
● signup users (number provided in config)
● each user creates random number of posts with any content (up to
max_posts_per_user)
● After creating the signup and posting activity, posts should be liked randomly, posts
can be liked multiple times
